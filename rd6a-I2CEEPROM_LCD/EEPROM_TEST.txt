Functional Specifications:
1.	RTOS Tasks
	a.	BUTTON_DET: 
		i.	Button press detect (BTN1)
			1.	Operates in PUSH-ON PUSH-OFF
		ii.	Toggles LED1
		iii. Send queue message to DATA_GEN to initiate test when button is
            pressed

	b.	DATA_GEN:  Generates random data array and write EEPROM 
		i.	Waits for BUTTON_DET message
		ii.	Turns on LEDA
		iii. Generates 1024 byte random array and random bytes (module 256) and
            random starting address (module 32768).
		iv.	Turns on LEDB
		v.	Writes starting address in hexadecimal to line one of the LCD
            (employs mutex semaphore #1)
		vi.	Turns off LEDB
		vii. Sends 1024 bytes of random values and starting address to
            DATA_CHK task using queue. (suggestion: consider structure to pass data)
		viii. Waits for results from DATA_CHK task
		ix.	Turns off LEDA 

	c.	DATA_CHK: Reads EEPROM and compares with data sent from DATA_GEN.
		i.	Waits for message queue from DATA_GEN task
		ii.	Writes starting address in hexadecimal to line two of the LCD
            (employs mutex semaphore #1)
		iii. Turns on LEDC
		iv.	Read EEPROM starting at address communicated by message
		v.	Turns off LEDC
		vi.	Compares 1024 bytes of data received from DATA_GEN with data read
            from EEPROM
		vii. Writes either "PASSED" or "FAILED" to second line of LCD following 
            the hexadecimal value of the starting address
            (employs mutex semaphore #1))
